This requires that an amount of work for each unit of credit course be institutionally established, \nrepresented in intended learning outcomes, and verified by evidence of student achievement.\n2.1.3 Credit Hours System\nA credit hour is a unit of measure representing the equivalent of a Class Contact Hour (one hour) of \ninstruction per week over the entire semester of minimum 15 weeks. Amity University follows the \nguideline set by UGC / AICTE & other relevant regulatory bodies and such other norms which are \nwidely applied by national and international Accrediting Bodies for determining the amount and level \nof credit to be awarded   for courses, regardless of format or mode of course delivery.\n2.1.4 Credit Hour Standard\nCredit defines the quantum of content/syllabus prescribed for the course. It may be a unit prescribed \nfor a course and is determined by the number of hours of instructions required per week. Thus, in each \ncourse credit will be assigned on the basis of the number of hours required per week for \nlectures/tutorials/lab work/field work/studio to complete the course in a single semester of duration \n15 to 18 Weeks with a minimum of 15 weeks teaching.

The term \nIndustry. 5.0 refers to people working alongside robots and smart machines. It's about robots helping \nhumans work better and faster by leveraging advanced technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) \nand big data. It adds a personal human touch to the Industry 4.0 pillars of automation and efficiency. \nWith Industry 5.0, the manufacturing process will be automated in a manner that real-time data will be \ncoming from the field.\nEducation 5.0 means the confluence of Technology  and human to explore newer possibilities. Industry \noriented education is an approach to learning from an industry perspective where traditional subject \nare taught in the context of application of the gained knowledge product design, development and \noperation. \nNine trends with regards to Education 5.0 by Peter Fisk\n2.3.1 Outcome Based Education \u2013 Programme Review\nAt Amity University, outcome-based education system is followed.

The relationship of PEOs and PLOs are clearly \nindicated through the mapping of learning outcomes with the established Objective. Course \nCurriculum coherence matrix provides the list of courses which contribute to learner\u2019s development for \nattaining specific course/programme learning outc0omes. Therefore, the students are required to \nunderstand intended learning outcomes at courses and programme level and focus on appropriate \nProfessional Skill Development Activities (PSDA) for attaining their learning outcomes. \n2.3.2 Course Review and Curriculum Development with focus on Course Learning Outcomes \n(CLOs) and their assessment.\nCourse review and curriculum development is a very systematic process in which the curriculum is \ndeveloped and reviewed with the involvement of all the stakeholders including industry, academy, \nresearch, alumni, and students. Further, the Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) are also defined at \ncourse level. A student is expected to achieve the specified learning outcomes on completion of a \ncourse / programme. This brings a greater onus of learning and self - development on a student, which \nmotivates the student to do self-directed learning in blended mode/flipped mode of teaching learning \nin the classrooms/laboratories and studios. The curriculum is designed in such a manner that students \nget sufficient exposure and hands on training through projects, field-work, assignment, seminars and \nconferences, workshops before they go for their training & industry related projects and finally when \nthey become eligible for placements. Immense focus is given to practical implication of their learning.\n2.3.3 Integration of Stakeholders\u2019 Feedbacks\nStakeholders Feedback is collected, analyzed and integrated for designing, developing a programme / \ncourse as per market demand and skill requirement of Industry. The student feedback is also taken into \nconsideration while reviewing the course curriculum for defining module weightage, LTP structure, \ncourse learning outcomes, assessment plan and learning resources.\n2.3.4 Integration of Professional Skill Development Activities (PSDA) and Revision of \nWeightage of Internal / External Assessment for the implementation of Education 5.0\nAs the University has implemented Education 5.0 for Emerging New Age / Disruptive Technologies \nwith competencies based on the requirement of Industry 5.0, the \u201cProfession Skill Development \nActivities (PSDA)\u201d have been integrated in the Course Curriculum for more inclusive Learning \nOutcomes and development of students at Course-Level. \nAll students are required to undertake integrated assignments/projects during the semester in their \nprogramme of study to enhance the creativity, adaptability, critical thinking by integrating learning of \nvarious courses for problem solving.\n2.4 \nlexible Choice Based Credit System for Multidisciplinary Education\nAmity University offers fully flexible Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) in its academic curriculum, in \nits endeavor to provide multi-disciplinary competencies, quality education and leadership skills.

The student learning outcomes are clearly \nstated at programme level and are instrumental in achieving the mission and objectives of the University.\nThe University has two methods of assessment of Course Level Learning Outcomes (CLOs) of the students \nas assessed through Continuous Assessment (CA), Professional Skill Development Activity (PSDA) and End \nSemester Examination. The Programme Learning Outcome (PLOs) of the students are assessed through \ndirect and indirect measures as under:\nDirect Measures:\na) Comprehensive Examination: This consists of an evaluation of the students on Program Level outcomes \nwhere evaluation is taken yearly based on the overall outcome of the different parameters ranging from \nKnowledge Management, IT skill to Problem- solving skills created and many others thus evaluating the \nstudents' capability in handling the Program Level Outcome. Comprehensive examinations are conducted \nduring even semester examination for all the programmes.\nb) Scoring Rubrics: Rubrics is another multidimensional tool used in evaluating students\u2019 work under the \nthree broad categories namely Communication Skills, Behavioural Skills, Global Outlook, Entrepreneurship \nSkills, Social Work, Environment Sustainability & NTCC. Students of all the programme are assessed at the \nend of even semester through these rubrics. \nIndirect Measures\na) Exit Survey: This method is used to assess the level of satisfaction of graduating students on a wide array \nof program attributes, to identify areas for program improvement, and to help measure change the \nstudent underwent over time. Exit survey is conducted for all the students of final year of their respective \nprograms during ESE.\nb) Attainment of Learning Outcomes & Graduate Attributes: For all the direct and indirect measures, for \nassessing specific Programme Learning Outcomes (PLOs), target for achievement level is defined. Based \non OAP results, assessment level of PLOs is analysed and accordingly action plan for improvement is planned.\nOn successful attainment of PLOs and GAs, students are also awarded a certificate of attainment of LOs \nfrom the University. If any student has not attended PLOs, is required to re-appear for assessment before \nConvocation.\nFurther, the PROAC assesses the learning outcomes at Programme Level and Institution Level to review the \nprogramme and curriculum.
